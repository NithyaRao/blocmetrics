Blocmetrics: API Tracking Service and Reporting Tool
 There are plenty of good analytic services, but that doesn't mean you can't build a better one. This analytics service will offer a few key features:

   - A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.
   - A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.
   - A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.
